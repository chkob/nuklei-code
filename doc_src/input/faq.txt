@defgroup faq F.A.Q.

@section faq_thread_safe Is Nuklei thread-safe?

Short answer: no.

Long answer:
-# There is no access synchronization in Nuklei class methods (an object should therefore not be accessed simultaneously from multiple threads).
-# Many Nuklei procedures require the generation of random numbers. Random numbers are provided by the GSL. The GSL random generator is held in a single global variable (see @p nuklei::randomRng in Random.cpp). I am unaware of synchronization mechanisms in GSL to prevent concurrent access to a random generator. Hence, concurrent calls to Nuklei procedures is dangerous.
